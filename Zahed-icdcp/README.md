Kamrul Hasan (Team leader) (ICDCP_42)
Task Completion Overview:
As as a team leader I created a github repo and add members as a collaborator.
Set up a rule for main branch as do not allow direct commit.
As a member of the team I created a new branch named [kamrul-icdcp_42].
Inside the brach I created a directory called [kamrul-icdcp_42].
Inside that directory I created a ReadMe.md file with some text.
Then I merged main branch with my created branch.
After documentation in the main branch ReadMe.md file.
